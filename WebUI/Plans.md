# Plans

## Tech Stack
Primary focus of this deployment is cross-platform capability

### Local Deployment
Python:
- Database: SQLite, which is a built-in database engine in Python and works on all major operating systems.
- Web Framework: Flask, a lightweight and easy-to-use web framework for Python. Flask runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Frontend: Jinja2 templates, which is often used with Flask to render HTML templates, or you can use a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js for more complex frontends. Both React and Vue.js are cross-platform and can run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Server-side Logic: Python, which is a cross-platform language, serves as the primary language for server-side logic. Flask runs on top of Python, making it easy to develop server-side components that are compatible with all three operating systems.


### At Scale Deployment
MERN:
- MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It has official support for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Express.js: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It can run on all major operating systems.
- React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's a front-end library and is entirely platform-agnostic, so it can run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, making it a versatile choice for server-side development.
