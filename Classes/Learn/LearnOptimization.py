"""
    Optimization: To minimize the number of steps, focus on feature selection, choosing the right model, and tuning hyperparameters. Libraries like scikit-learn provide tools for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning (like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV).

    Evaluation: After training your model, evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification problems; or MSE, RMSE for regression problems). This evaluation will help you understand if your model is performing well.
